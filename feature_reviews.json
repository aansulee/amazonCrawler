Rosetta seems to work great with certain \"unsupported\" applications, in some cases not expecting it to work at all, and would without any hiccups or noticeable slowness. This was the case with Runelite and enabling the GPU plugin made the experience buttery-smooth on an LG 3440x1440 IPS display.\n\nHowever, Firefox (without installing the beta M1 supported version) would consistently freeze and crash and it seemed to be ruled out by plugins, but even without that, certain websites wouldn't work and loading pages after each click took way too long. I experienced another bug with Discord and couldn't see its login setup screen due to what seemed like a file association or visual glitch, and I found out there's no good uninstaller option natively on macOS other than just binning applications to the trash and clearing it from there. So, I had to uninstaller a third-party app to remove all file associations when the application was installed to finally get a clean install and thankfully the Discord install worked well after that.\n\nThe other downsides for me are general unsupported SOC from various companies/applications, in case I wanted to setup a VM. No eGPU support, and no RAM upgradeability, but that's a given considering the new SOC, just would have been nice to upgrade on our own (and hopefully have made design tweaks to make those upgrades easier for users). Would also have been nice to see a smaller footprint for the enclosure, since it's quite a small SOC based on images I've seen online.\n\nYou may find yourself feeling like a beta tester, it can get pretty frustrating.

I recently sold my Mac Pro and matching Pro Display (add them up: $12,000), and just sold both: I figured Apple would migrate to a new, proprietary chip, and they have done so. And when I heard through the rumor vine that they were going to issue one, and possibly two, Mac Pros (one is reportedly half the size of the current monster, and the other will be same-sized), plus a less expensive, consumer-oriented display, I figured it was the time to get an interim Mac computer to hold me over for a year or two.\n\nI bought the Mac Mini with the M1 chip and 8GB of memory, with the Apple-sponsored LG monitor (Ultrafine display, 5K), and assumed it'd be clear sailing.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nThe first problem is that, no matter what anyone tells you, you're better off getting the 16GB of memory, because otherwise you'll be swapping memory constantly, with three or more programs open, and using software to clear the RAM. The second problem is a software glitch or hardware glitch in the graphics processor that causes jagged lines of text! This is a random issue, which makes it even more frustrating, because it can't be isolated and resolved by the user. The third problem is that you cannot hook up two Apple-sponsored LG monitors to it (the 5K and the 4K), which is what I wanted to do. In fact, if you want to hook up two monitors, it MAY be possible, but Apple users online are reporting difficulty in doing so.

But the Mac mini M1 has flaws that may make you wish you had waited for a new, improved model. It's good value for the money, to be sure, but the iMacs have proven to be more reliable, and of course, the latest Mac Pro I had (which was more power than I needed, which is why I sold it) was a real workhorse, and a showpiece: I'll happily buy the forthcoming Mac Pro with the M1 chip when it's announced.", [2], [384, 385, 512, 516, 135, 136, 264, 391, 271, 273, 150, 151, 280, 408, 414, 37, 426, 428, 433, 178, 306, 436, 442, 187, 59, 315, 191, 192, 450, 455, 200, 328, 456, 333, 463, 95, 352, 481, 228, 234], ["review", 15]], [1.0, 0.0, "Not For Business Professionals", "I really wanted to like this machine.

I say business professional because many YouTuber\u2019s feel that being in media creation is the the holy grail of a professional work space, when it is not. So a lot of information presented there is heavily biased in that way. I am an accountant, I occasionally dabble into content creation. This machine, for me, was not great at handling my professional needs so it was useless to me.\n\nI got a constant message saying that the unit was low on memory when it wasn\u2019t.

I have always considered Apple products to be vastly superior to other personal computers on the market and their OS to be unquestionably the best. Well, this Mac mini may change my mind. First of all, if you simply want a computer to browse the internet, send email, etc., it is a speed demon expert at that. If you want other things, like normal dual monitors, external boot drives, etc., then this computer has its issues. Now running OS 11.3, I have no ability to boot from an external Thunderbolt 3 drive. I had that ability with 11.1 but lost it when I upgraded the system. Don't even think about booting from any sort of USB drive. It will NOT work. USB drives of any type (SSD, HD, Thumb) serve as file storage containers... not boot drives. The monitor situation is truly strange. A HDMI and a USB-C monitor will work together but it will not support two HDMI or two USB-C monitors. I finally settled on one HDMI and one VGA (through a USB-C VGA hub). They seem to work well together. I also attempted to use the Luna Display adapter for allowing my iPad Air to be a first or second display. You cannot use the VGA adapter or any type adapter when the Luna adapter is plugged into the USB-C port or the Luna will not work. There are sometimes costs to being early adapters and this seems to be the case with the M1 Mac mini. Though it does read/writes to its custom memory at nearly 3000MBs and loads native software very rapidly, it really just isn't ready for prime time yet for a lot of users. OK, maybe the base mini isn't considered a power user's machine but I'm not asking for things out of the ordinary. My Intel based Macs have no issues with adapters, monitors, SSD drives or anything else. They just work... and one is 12 years old.

I say business professional because many YouTuber\u2019s feel that being in media creation is the the holy grail of a professional work space, when it is not. So a lot of information presented there is heavily biased in that way. I am an accountant, I occasionally dabble into content creation.

But do yourself a favor and save your money and get a Dell XPS, HP Envy or Spectre, or a Lenovo.

This was the case with Runelite and enabling the GPU plugin made the experience buttery-smooth on an LG 3440x1440 IPS display.\n\nHowever, Firefox (without installing the beta M1 supported version) would consistently freeze and crash and it seemed to be ruled out by plugins, but even without that, certain websites wouldn't work and loading pages after each click took way too long. I experienced another bug with Discord and couldn't see its login setup screen due to what seemed like a file association or visual glitch, and I found out there's no good uninstaller option natively on macOS other than just binning applications to the trash and clearing it from there. So, I had to uninstaller a third-party app to remove all file associations when the application was installed to finally get a clean install and thankfully the Discord install worked well after that.\n\nThe other downsides for me are general unsupported SOC from various companies/applications, in case I wanted to setup a VM. No eGPU support, and no RAM upgradeability, but that's a given considering the new SOC, just would have been nice to upgrade on our own (and hopefully have made design tweaks to make those upgrades easier for users).

So... it went from three stars to a 5 star machine and I almost never give 5 stars to anything.\n\nI have had no issues with this machineAs a Mac user since 1984, this is a difficult review. I have always considered Apple products to be vastly superior to other personal computers on the market and their OS to be unquestionably the best. Well, this Mac mini may change my mind. First of all, if you simply want a computer to browse the internet, send email, etc., it is a speed demon expert at that. If you want other things, like normal dual monitors, external boot drives, etc., then this computer has its issues. Now running OS 11.3, I have no ability to boot from an external Thunderbolt 3 drive. I had that ability with 11.1 but lost it when I upgraded the system. Don't even think about booting from any sort of USB drive. It will NOT work. USB drives of any type (SSD, HD, Thumb) serve as file storage containers... not boot drives. The monitor situation is truly strange. A HDMI and a USB-C monitor will work together but it will not support two HDMI or two USB-C monitors. I finally settled on one HDMI and one VGA (through a USB-C VGA hub). They seem to work well together. I also attempted to use the Luna Display adapter for allowing my iPad Air to be a first or second display. You cannot use the VGA adapter or any type adapter when the Luna adapter is plugged into the USB-C port or the Luna will not work. There are sometimes costs to being early adapters and this seems to be the case with the M1 Mac mini. Though it does read/writes to its custom memory at nearly 3000MBs and loads native software very rapidly, it really just isn't ready for prime time yet for a lot of users. OK, maybe the base mini isn't considered a power user's machine but I'm not asking for things out of the ordinary. My Intel based Macs have no issues with adapters, monitors, SSD drives or anything else. They just work... and one is 12 years old.

I recently sold my Mac Pro and matching Pro Display (add them up: $12,000), and just sold both: I figured Apple would migrate to a new, proprietary chip, and they have done so. And when I heard through the rumor vine that they were going to issue one, and possibly two, Mac Pros (one is reportedly half the size of the current monster, and the other will be same-sized), plus a less expensive, consumer-oriented display, I figured it was the time to get an interim Mac computer to hold me over for a year or two.\n\nI bought the Mac Mini with the M1 chip and 8GB of memory, with the Apple-sponsored LG monitor (Ultrafine display, 5K), and assumed it'd be clear sailing.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nThe first problem is that, no matter what anyone tells you, you're better off getting the 16GB of memory, because otherwise you'll be swapping memory constantly, with three or more programs open, and using software to clear the RAM. The second problem is a software glitch or hardware glitch in the graphics processor that causes jagged lines of text! This is a random issue, which makes it even more frustrating, because it can't be isolated and resolved by the user. The third problem is that you cannot hook up two Apple-sponsored LG monitors to it (the 5K and the 4K), which is what I wanted to do. In fact, if you want to hook up two monitors, it MAY be possible, but Apple users online are reporting difficulty in doing so. (Your mileage will vary.)\n\nBottom line: I'd skip the Mac mini M1 and wait for them to come out with an iMac with the M1 chip. Then you'll be able to add the memory you need, have a beautiful screen, and possibly a new classy chassis because the rumor is that the iMac for 2021 will be redesigned and resemble the Apple DXR display: the iMac hasn't changed its basic look in, oh, years.\n\nApple makes great products. But the Mac mini M1 has flaws that may make you wish you had waited for a new, improved model.

I recently sold my Mac Pro and matching Pro Display (add them up: $12,000), and just sold both: I figured Apple would migrate to a new, proprietary chip, and they have done so. And when I heard through the rumor vine that they were going to issue one, and possibly two, Mac Pros (one is reportedly half the size of the current monster, and the other will be same-sized), plus a less expensive, consumer-oriented display, I figured it was the time to get an interim Mac computer to hold me over for a year or two.\n\nI bought the Mac Mini with the M1 chip and 8GB of memory, with the Apple-sponsored LG monitor (Ultrafine display, 5K), and assumed it'd be clear sailing.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nThe first problem is that, no matter what anyone tells you, you're better off getting the 16GB of memory, because otherwise you'll be swapping memory constantly, with three or more programs open, and using software to clear the RAM. The second problem is a software glitch or hardware glitch in the graphics processor that causes jagged lines of text! This is a random issue, which makes it even more frustrating, because it can't be isolated and resolved by the user. The third problem is that you cannot hook up two Apple-sponsored LG monitors to it (the 5K and the 4K), which is what I wanted to do. In fact, if you want to hook up two monitors, it MAY be possible, but Apple users online are reporting difficulty in doing so. (Your mileage will vary.)\n\nBottom line: I'd skip the Mac mini M1 and wait for them to come out with an iMac with the M1 chip. Then you'll be able to add the memory you need, have a beautiful screen, and possibly a new classy chassis because the rumor is that the iMac for 2021 will be redesigned and resemble the Apple DXR display: the iMac hasn't changed its basic look in, oh, years.\n\nApple makes great products. But the Mac mini M1 has flaws that may make you wish you had waited for a new, improved model. It's good value for the money, to be sure, but the iMacs have proven to be more reliable, and of course, the latest Mac Pro I had (which was more power than I needed, which is why I sold it) was a real workhorse, and a showpiece: I'll happily buy the forthcoming Mac Pro with the M1 chip when it's announced.", [2], [384, 512, 516, 135, 136, 264, 391, 271, 273, 150, 151, 280, 408, 414, 37, 426, 428, 433, 178, 306, 436, 442, 187, 59, 315, 191, 192, 450, 455, 200, 328, 456, 333, 463, 95, 352, 481, 228, 234, 244], ["review", 15]]], "Noise level": [3.5, 0.23087500000000002, [5.0, 0.743, "Way better than I could have imagined", "It\u2019s pretty incredible just how efficient and powerful this new M1 processor is.

My MBP would get so loud I thought it was going to blow out a fan motor.\n\nThe only draw I see for this machine is its video out limitations. You can only run one video signal via the HDMI channel, and one via both Thunderbolt ports. No combo of the two, so my Caldigit TS3+ can no longer simultaneously drive my 4K DisplayPort monitor AND my 1080p hdmi monitor - I have to run one from the mini\u2019s HDMI port, and the other from the Thunderbolt port.

I experienced another bug with Discord and couldn't see its login setup screen due to what seemed like a file association or visual glitch, and I found out there's no good uninstaller option natively on macOS other than just binning applications to the trash and clearing it from there. So, I had to uninstaller a third-party app to remove all file associations when the application was installed to finally get a clean install and thankfully the Discord install worked well after that.\n\nThe other downsides for me are general unsupported SOC from various companies/applications, in case I wanted to setup a VM. No eGPU support, and no RAM upgradeability, but that's a given considering the new SOC, just would have been nice to upgrade on our own (and hopefully have made design tweaks to make those upgrades easier for users).
