[{"polarity": "pos", "name": "Amazon Addict", "stars": 5.0, "title": "Superior to most! Love it!", "content": "I was surprised to see no reviews for the Jet 75 and there is no youtube videos either. Before I made my purchase I relied on the youtube reviews of the Jet 90 which is essentially the same vacuum but with the mop attachment (as far as I gathered.)\n\nJust to give you a little background: We have tiles, laminate and area rugs. I come from using mid range corded vacuums and I have never made such an expensive purchase before for a cleaning tool. We have two dogs, one of which sheds - a mini pincher, the other one does not- wheaten terrier. You might say that given the small size of the mini pincher, I shouldn't complain about the hair on the floor and furniture but believe me, I vacuum 2 times a day and there is still hair to be cleaned.\n\nI initially purchased a cheaper stick vacuum which did not satisfy my cleaning needs but did show me that you can't beat the convenience of cordless if you vacuum multiple times a day.\n\nSo here I am, giving you my initial thoughts on this \"monster\" of a vacuum stick.\n\nThe Jet 75 is very powerful! You wouldn't believe it! I am beyond impressed with the suction power and ease of use. Here are my pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- cordless (obviously)\n- power - the low setting is fine (about 110-120 AW), mid level is awesome (around 140-150 AW), and the high is insane (around 200 AW.) It actually makes it a bit hard to vacuum a carpet on high cause it sucks so hard and needs a stronger push -some may consider this a con where I don't mind it. No such issues on tile or hardwood floors.\n- attachments - there are plenty with my favorites- fabric/furniture/bedding brush and the elbow flex attachment.\n- great range of motion all around.\n\nCons:\n- it's a bit heavy in the hand- most of the weight is in the battery but that's not something you can part with to use it.\n- no LED floor light- it really helps to have it and I don't know why Samsung chose not to integrate it to the unit. I just purchased a battery operated closet stick led which I plan to mount on the front. Just ordered it today so not sure how well my plan would work yet. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089JYP45L/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_HywnFbY14M8Z9\n- mine came with no documentation- very odd as it didn't appear to be a used item. All is available online but I guess I'm used to Samsung's manual books.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing stick vacuum! If you are in the market for one, I would highly suggest you add this to your comparing list.\nPersonally, I was torn between the Jet 75 and the LG A9. The mate red LG which is in the same price point as the Jet 75, comes with an additional battery but suction strength is rated at 140 AW. Also, the LG comes with a floor stand should you not want to attach it to a wall or inside a cabinet. I went for the power.\n\nBut why not a Dyson, you ask? To me Dyson's are overpriced for the mediocre job they are able to achieve. One of my closest friends has a Dyson stick. The vacuum is a joke. I can't even compare it to the Jet 75 because you shouldn't compare apples to lemons . The only suggestion I would give is to look up the suction power and compare. At this time, a 200 AW Dyson costs $1000. It's insane what good marketing can do for a business lol\n\nI didn't mean to make this review so long but wanted to share my experience. If you have any questions, please free to ask and if I can, I'll give you an answer.\nOverall, the Jet 75 is awesome and if you are willing to spend the money, I very highly recommend it.", "helpful": 269}, {"polarity": "pos", "name": "CP", "stars": 4.0, "title": "Comparing to a Dyson V10", "content": "Edit: I didn't get this free, paid for it.\n\nBox arrived opened as it was sealed with one piece of tape. The product box looks like it\u2019s been re-taped as well. Returned and ordered from Samsung.\n\nThis vacuum has a higher peak suction than the V10 but the battery only lasts 6 minutes. I haven't run scientific testing but the Jet on medium seems to be about as powerful as the Dyson on max. The Jet on max produces 200 air Watts of power (whatever that means) and on shaggy carpet, the Jet can be difficult to push unlike the Dyson.\n\nThe sound level on the Jet is MUCH quieter than the Dyson V10 on any level.\n\nThe Jet is heavier than the Dyson, it's noticeable. Samsung says the Jet is 6 lbs but it feels heavier.\n\nThe Jet battery is removable/replaceable unlike the Dyson. It comes with a wall dock and charger but there's no way to plug the charger directly into the vacuum like the Dyson.\n\nThe dustbin on the Jet doesn't have a bottom opening hatch. You have to remove the dustbin, take out the filter/center portion and empty the dustbin. It's kind of a hassle so I got the Clean Station which automagically empties the bin (a special bin that's included with the clean station).\n\nOverall as a vacuum, the Samsung Jet is better than the Dyson. It's heavier than the V10 but if purchased with the Clean Station, eliminates a big issue I had with the Dyson.", "helpful": 34}, {"polarity": "pos", "name": "Melrel05", "stars": 5.0, "title": "Love it!", "content": " This is my first ever stick vacuum so this review isn\u2019t going to be a comparison between other stick vacuums but rather about the switch from a traditional vacuum.\n\nI\u2019m in love with this Samsung stick vacuum! The suction on it is fantastic. It has 3 levels of suction and even the lowest setting has some power to it. The highest setting I can\u2019t even push forward on carpet or rugs. To much suction for that! It\u2019s also fairly quiet for a vacuum. Even the highest setting isn\u2019t as loud as my regular vacuum. It\u2019s pretty light weight and the maneuverability is amazing. Since the head is smaller and the body is a stick I can easily get under beds and other objects that I couldn\u2019t do with a regular vacuum. The convenience of it is also fantastic! You just lift it up to take it off the charger, press a button and choose a power setting and go. And when your done you just put it right back on the dock charger. It comes with all the attachments in my photo. I have a home that has mostly hardwood floors except for one large room in the basement that has carpet. We also have multiple rugs around the house. This can definitely tackle all of the above m, however I will say Th at if you have all or mostly carpet this probably isn\u2019t for you. Which brings me to the cons.\n\nBeing this was the first stick vacuum I\u2019ve ever had I\u2019ve learned over the last week what the differences are in a regular vacuum and a stick vacuum. As I said before if you have all or mostly carpet in your home this isn\u2019t going to be for you. While it does work well on all my rugs and it can do a carpet pretty well my old school vacuum works better for carpet. Don\u2019t get me wrong this does clean them, but not as deep and as well. It\u2019s head is also smaller so it takes A bit longer. Also the battery doesn\u2019t last very long. It says 1 hour on lowest setting and without any power attachments. Which means the only things that last an hour are the crevice tools... I got about 20-25 min on full power, and about 35 min on med power. Charging takes almost 4 hours to fully charge. I\u2019m definitely going to need to purchase an extra battery because when I\u2019m cleaning I don\u2019t want to have to stop for hours to wait for it to charge. Also the attachments don\u2019t all fir with the docking and you will have to store some separately Mx I wish they were all in one spot. Also emptying it could be a bit better/easier. I wish there was just a button to press that you could hold it over the trash and it would Cope and close. Instead you have to press a button, unscrew the top, take the bottom and top it over to dump it out then put it back together. It\u2019s not super hard but it\u2019s annoying and could be better.\n\nOverall I\u2019m not docking any points because of the above mentioned cons. Only because it is my understanding this is all typical for a stick vacuum.

And it has these strips of material that behaves like a lint brush and collects fur and lint so you have to scrape to clean it afterwards. Pointless. I've attached a photo of the brush head after I vacuumed to carpeted stairs and then after I scraped the accumulated debris off the strips. The mini motorized tool on my old Dyson is engineered much better. Aside from that it's great: easy to use, easy to maneuver, easy to clean and lightweight.

I thought any cordless vacuum would not have the power needed to really do the job, but I was wrong. This Samsung cordless is a whole new world. I am wondering why I waited so long to purchase this gem. It really sucks, in the best possible way. I can use it on medium level and it does a great job of picking everything up. I have found that I rarely have to use the high power level. As others have mentioned, it is a bit heavy due to the battery, but not so heavy that it is really a problem and I love the power the battery provides. It maneuvers very easily, around and under furniture, works great on area rugs, but not sure how easy it would be to push on a high pile carpet. I wish it stood up by itself. You have to lean it against something or lay it down or hook back up on the charging station. You do have to have a place to conveniently install and plug in the battery charging station.

Great suction and light weight, perfect for stairs", "content": "I've had several upright vacuums over the past 20 years, each carefully researched for the best reviews, strongest suction and the appropriate accessories. Each is still going strong and we even added a few Roombas into the mix to keep up with all the mess, but with 2 large, long hair dogs, using the uprights on the stairs was getting to be too much, making matters worse, my wife couldn't use the uprights on the stairs. Until iRobot invents a stair climbing robotic vacuum, I needed something that would get into the corners of the carpeted stairs as well as the foot surface and was light enough to carry up and down 2 full flights of stairs. I did a lot of research and narrowed the choices down to the Samsung Jet series and the various new Dyson V series. There is a channel on Youtube that does reviews and the review from Dec 2020 was very positive about the Samsung Jet 90 and it compared very favorably to the much more expensive Dysons. Since this purchase is intended to deal with the stairs and occasional spot cleaning to catch the hair tumbleweeds during shedding season, this didn't have to have the longest battery life or the widest vacuum head. The 75 is exactly the same vacuum as the Jet 90, only it doesn't include the upright charging stand and an extendible tube. This is an additional vacuum to the Roombas and the uprights, so I picked this up when it went on sale and haven't regretted it at all.\n\nI've used it a few times and was amazed at how much hair the powered head was able to pull out of the stair carpet. I thought the stairs were reasonably clean, but I emptied the bin 3 times before finishing! I originally thought that I'd need the small powered head to do the stairs, but the large head and the extension were light enough to be able to easily and quickly do all the stairs without breaking a sweat (can't say that about the upright corded vacs!). Also, the head articulation is very good so it was easy to clean both right to left as well as left to right, so I felt the design made it easier to do a more complete job.\n\nI've played around with the soft powered head for hard surfaces, and it works fine, but since the Roomba does a good job maintaining the floors, I don't expect to use it too much.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great vacuum and I'm happy with the purchase!", "helpful": 1}, {"polarity": "pos", "name": "Rena Killian", "stars": 4.0, "title": "Light weight and works OK", "content": "The vacuum was easy to put together and maneuvers great; goes under cabinets fairly well, too.

Putting the cannister back on after emptying is a bit of a challenge. You need to carefully line up the connections and make sure it snaps into place. Also, the vacuum will not stand up by itself. You can carefully balance it on a cabinet of something, but it won't stand alone. The battery indicator has 3 lights and, after using to clean 1 room, it's down to 2. I've never run out of charge so I don't know if this is normal or if it will run down.\nThere is an indicator light that appears when vacuuming a carpet. I think it means that the roller has been stopped by the carpet pile. (It shows in the manual but it never explains what it is. I called Samsung but the person didn't know what it meant, either.)

Conversely the Bissell was considerably heavier but considerably more powerful, so it was more of an effort to use but did a better job.\n\nThe Samsung offers the best of both worlds. It\u2019s a little heavier than my Orfeld but significantly lighter than my Bissell, and - crucially - it also seems to be almost as powerful as the Bissell. Level three power with the Samsung is more than I\u2019d ever need in my apartment with its laminate floors and no rugs. Lightness and power. Who could ask for more?\n\nIt also feels *smoother* than both of my other sticks. I can\u2019t see any obvious differences in the construction of the brush head so I don\u2019t know why, but it just feels nicer to push back and forth than both of my other vacuums. It\u2019s a real pleasure to use.\n\nFinally it looks great. I don\u2019t get all hot and bothered about the looks of a vacuum cleaner, but this one is very sleek and cool looking. Nice styling.\n\nNow, I have just one complaint that\u2019s going to cost the Samsung a star: it won\u2019t stand up on its own. My Orfeld vacuum has a clever clip in the head that allows you to finish vacuuming and just leave it standing wherever you want, and it\u2019s one of my favourite features. It may not seem like much, but there\u2019s just something about finishing the job, dropping the vacuum where it lays and wandering off to do something more fun that fills me with glee, and I wish I could do the same with the Samsung. Instead the Samsung has a docking station that can be attached to a wall. That\u2019s the only way it\u2019ll stand, and if you don\u2019t want to drill into a wall you\u2019ll have to just lay it down flat somewhere.\n\nIs this a dealbreaker? Of course not. This is a great vacuum, better in many ways than my Orfeld. I just wish Samsung had included that one killer feature for people who celebrate laziness as much as I do.

All the attachments are easy to connect and remove from the vacuum. My home has mainly hardwood floors and then tiles for our kitchens and bathrooms, so the soft brush works great for both. For all the tight areas between my furniture, the long crevice attachment is the perfect tool.\nThe vacuum has 3 suctions levels that you can easily adjust on the digital display\nThe dust bin is super easy to empty.

This is our first stick vacuum and I am in love! I am actually going to start getting rid of our vacuum collection because this vacuum replaces them.\n\nThe suction on this is great. I used my Dyson Ball to very thoroughly vacuum a plush area rug that sees a lot of animal and kid action. I followed it up with using this Samsung Jet and was shocked and excited at how much pet hair and fine dust it picked up, directly after being vacuumed well by another!\n\nOur house is predominately tile and I have always struggled to find a vacuum that could handle it. Some vacuums struggled picking up fine dust or bigger particles (I'll sweep after vacuuming and be disgusted at how much was left behind by the vacuum). All vacuums I've had have always kicked things around when using the roller brush, like small pebbles or cat litter (even the Dyson which was superior on my tile than anything else I tried). I used this Samsung on the medium setting and got to work and nothing got kicked up! I even tested it around our litter boxes and seamlessly went from hard floor to litter covered rugs and not once did I feel, see or hear litter getting sprayed from the rolling brush. I am seriously still in awe. I did the broom test after I vacuumed and was pleased to see that my broom didn't discover any fine dust left behind.\n\nAnother thing I vacuum are my blinds. I was worried that this would be harder to use as I'd have to lift the whole thing up as opposed to the hose of the upright, but I discovered that it was actually easier as I wasn't fighting against the weight of the upright vacuum nor having to make sure I moved the vacuum with me. The brush attachment was perfect at getting the blinds dust free\n\nThe attachments are all useful and work well. They snap on and off with easy and feel sturdy when on. The charging station has a convenient location to store them.\n\nThe battery life is adequate. I can get most of the main rooms of my house done in one charge, toggling between medium and high. I have yet to have it die and leave me in a lurch cleaning wise, especially with planning. I do plan on getting an extra battery though for convenience sake in case I have ambitious cleaning days.\n\nIt does really well with pet hair and litter. I have two large shepherd/lab mixes and a long hair and short hair cat and this vacuum and canister handle the hair and mess really well. The dirt canister does a great job at separating the hair so that it doesn't prematurely block the intake which means I can go a lot longer without having to empty it. Emptying it is super easy and clean too, the hair slides off easily and I have yet had to reach in and touch it to get the hair out the way I've had to in \"touchless\" emptying canisters on other brands.\n\nIt's also easily the quietest vacuum I have had. Its still a vacuum, its not whisper quiet, but I can actually have conversations while using it and my husband can easily hear the TV.\n\nThe biggest downside to this vacuum is that it comes with three power-heads but no way to store two of them. Ideally these would click in the charging station somewhere, but I'd even settle for them having the right shape or notches to allow them to me more easily and securely hung elsewhere.\n\nIt also is a bit frustrating to use on rugs, particularly runners and smaller, lighter rugs. It does really well on my 5x7 carpet rug and it does a great job on indoor.outdoor rubber based rugs of various sizes, but the roller seizes up and it becomes hard to push on runners and thinner smaller area rugs, even on the low power setting. Its not a total deal breaker as its still utilizing the suction, and I do appreciate that it smartly stops the roller to avoid damage, but I do wish it could be a bit more rug savy.", "helpful": 7}, {"polarity": "pos", "name": "PenKay", "stars": 5.0, "title": "Best design for a stick cleaner we've ever used", "content": "Samsung Jet 75 Complete Stick Lightweight Cleaner\n\nHonestly, I swore I wouldn't get another stick cleaner since everyone we have used, including some pricey brands, has had problems of one kind or another. The thing is, we've got cats and hardwood stairs and there simply is no convenient substitute for getting the hair that accumulates at the corner of every step, and corners in general, where a robotic vacuum can't quite reach. Since we've never been disappointed with our Samsung electronics and appliances, I thought we'd give their stick vacuum a try. I've got to say that this is the easiest and most effective one that we've ever owned. It's got great balance and isn't tiring to hold; there are three suction levels which saves both battery charge and is a lot quieter if all you are doing is getting loose hair and dust; the attachments are modular and can be used with or without the extension tube; it's easy to change attachments but they still lock into place securely; and finally, the charging cradle can be mounted on the wall and the whole unit glides right into it and lifts smoothly out again. There are three power brush attachments: one for furniture, one for area rugs and carpet, and one that does fantastic at getting dust and hair off hardwood and tile floors.

Within the first week of using the vacuum, I came to the conclusion this is my favorite vacuum I own.\n\nMy only complaints about the JET 75 is the battery life, charging, and not being able to leave the vacuum standing. I wish the battery last just 1 more day longer. Having a pair of Aussie's, my house becomes inundated with hair in no time. Charging the JET 75 is kind of a pain to me because I have not attached the unit to the wall so it requires me to remove the battery when I need to charge. Otherwise, you can just slip the unit on the charging station. A small issue is the JET 75 can not be left standing up on it's own, I constantly have to find a place to lean it up against. Small issue but it is something.\n\nEnough of the complaints, I just want to say the suction and power of this vacuum is the best I've used. On top of being quite powerful, it is relatively quiet compared to my other vacuums. I believe my dogs will agree with me as well as they seem not to be as scared of the JET 75.

We have a houseful of animals \u2013 dogs, cats and birds and it works great for cleaning up after all of them. The turbo action brush works well on area rugs, but I find I need to turn down the power when cleaning smaller rugs or it tries to suck them up. Battery is adequate for light cleaning of two large rooms. Battery lasts a little longer if you don\u2019t run it on high all the time. The attachments do not lend themselves well to cleaning carpeted stairs, which is something I was hoping for. The crevice tool worked fine around the edge, but the only attachment that worked well on the stair treads is the turbo action brush, which is too large so it is awkward.

I have stick vacuums from Samsung\u2019s primary competitor and this vacuum includes more options than a similarly priced competitor\u2019s model. Included with the kit are: Mini Motorized Tool, Crevice Tool, Brush Tool, Turbo Floor Tool, Soft Motorized Floor Tool, Flexible Extension Hose, and a Wall Mount. All the accessories have a nice, premium feel and are easily interchanged, that latch and click solidly into place.\n\nAt 6 pounds, the vacuum can be used for extended periods of time without feeling overly heavy or burdensome at the end of sweeping. One of the best features of the vacuum and its attachments is that the turbo brush heads can rotate up to 180 degrees. This easily allows the brush head to go under furniture for easy cleaning. A VERY NICE FEATURE. The vacuum has an on/off button that controls the cleaning modes and power of the unit. Low, Medium, High, and Wet. It must be noted that the Jet 75 does not include the accessories to utilize the Wet cleaning mode of the vacuum.\n\nI had never given it any thought about not having a trigger to turn the vacuum on and off. This is the first vacuum without a trigger. I must admit, now that I don\u2019t have a trigger for control, I like it better than I thought. The ability to change the power level with just a button click and not having to hold down the trigger is a welcome change. I don\u2019t think I would want to go back.\n\nSamsung claims up to 60 minutes of runtime out of a fully charged battery (recharging can take up to 3.5 hours). While I originally thought that was just a marketing claim, I can say that goal is not out of reach. The majority of my home is hardwood. I can vacuum all my hardwood and tile floors, using the Medium power setting and the soft, motorized turbo brush, and still have 2 out of 3 bars remaining on the battery. I have more than enough power left to vacuum the remaining carpeted rooms with the Turbo Motorized Brush without needing to charge between. Very Impressive. This is something I cannot get anywhere close to with my current competitor\u2019s stick vacuum.\n\nNEGATIVES\nWhile I have no issues using the vacuum, taller members of my family seem to feel the vacuum could be a little longer / taller. Family members over 6 feet seem to think they need to bend over more than competitor\u2019s products to keep the brush heads in proper contact with the floor. However, those of us not more than 6 feet tall, don\u2019t seem to have any of those issues. So, to be fair to Samsung, it could just be a user issue.\n\nWhile I really like the soft, motorized brush head for my hardwoods and tile floors, I feel that it has some issues sucking up debris on the backward sweeping stroke. Using the soft brush head on the medium power setting, the motorized tool seems to do a better job at removing dirt and debris from the hardwoods on the forward cleaning stroke than when pulling it back toward me while sweeping. Again, to be fair, this could possibly be remedied by using the High-power setting. But that would prevent me from being able to clean an entire story on a single charge. I must point out, that this tool has zero issues getting that dirt and debris on the forward stroke. So, I believe it to be a function of the rotation of the roller and the way it covers my hardwoods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nI like this vacuum. It is considerably quieter than its competitor and delivers an impressive amount of runtime off a single charge. The vacuum does a good job on hardwood, tile, and even carpet. The Motorized Turbo Brush will pick the carpet\u2019s nap back up just a well as my full-size electric vacuum.

It doesn't automatically adjust the suction for the various floor types. The last and worst reason for me. It is LITERALLY a pain to empty the dust bin. It has to be popped off the vaccuum completely then the filter taken off which is supposed to be easy but after a couple uses it sticks and has to be pried open, it has given me a nasty static shock on more than 1 occasion and it's a mess to dump.

Hopefully they fix this...", "content": "We're coming from years of owning a Dyson and only went with Samsung because of a good deal and promising reviews. This vacuum could be so amazing if it weren't for the major design flaw we encountered the very first week and the extremely frustrating customer service.\n\nThe first few days were great! Everything worked as it should. 5 days in and the turbo action brush (the main attachment for carpet and rugs) stopped spinning. No problem, Samsung makes it super easy to simply press a button and pull the brush part out. Love this feature! Unfortunately that didn't fix it. Apparently a huge wad of hair got tightly wrapped around the INNER part of the end of the brush head where it is inaccessible to get to. After days of messing with it (we have engineers in the family) I finally had to break the brush off that side panel to get inside and verify this. I only dared do that because I have a new turbo action brush coming under warranty and I wanted to see how I can prevent this from happening again. Looks like I can't. \ud83d\ude1e\n\nI understand that hair gets caught in the spinning mechanisms of all vacuums, but it is vital to allow access to clean these parts! We actually thought there was no way hair got into that little end piece and made it stop spinning, especially within only days of using the vacuum. But we were wrong and completely blown away at the wad that somehow got into a non-accessible spot (see included photos). There is a screw inside there that holds the brush head on but you can't get to that screw unless you break off the black plastic tabs securing the end piece on. They need to change that to small screws that allow access to this area. And fix the mechanism itself so hair cannot pass through into that area. As you can see in the 2nd photo, the inner black circle has rough brittle plastic that grabs hair and that's where the wad was securely stuck.\n\nLastly, Samsung customer service throughout this ordeal was a nightmare in and of itself. It was nearly impossible to get a hold of anyone and whenever I did, it was either the wrong department or they didn't speak very well English. That's fine as long as they can help me. Reaching customer service via chat was super easy when ordering, and they were really nice. But after you order it's a different department that handles these issues. The chat feature sent me to where I needed to go and I actually laughed out loud when I saw the wait time. Over 7 hours. With 3 people ahead of me. I waited a few days and tried again, but it was the same. They give an option to text but that department is super understaffed and/or busy too and just kept messaging saying sorry they are too busy and will get back to me when an agent is available. They never did and I've tried daily to get through. I finally got a hold of someone by waiting several hours for the online chat and they claim a new turbo action brush head will be sent. It wasn't. After days of trying to get a hold of them again and winning the lottery of getting an agent one day, they said it wasn't shipped and to wait a couple more weeks. I got upset at that point and they escalated the call which resulted in them promising to expedite the replacement brush head within 2 days. That came and went. Now I'm still waiting. We'll see if it eventually comes.\n\nNow, I don't mean to be so negative about this vacuum because with those issues aside, I really do like it. There are features that surpass my Dyson V8 Absolute like the extendable crevice tool (so cool!) and the inner brushes coming out for easy cleaning with the push of a button. There's an extra step to emptying the dust bin that I worried about since the Dyson is super easy in that regard, but it's not too bad. Dyson definitely wins in that area though with their simple lever to empty the canister. However, I've heard it's easier to wash out the Samsung canister because of how it empties.\n\nI'm hoping my review will help those out there who have hair around their home that can get trapped in that inaccessible end piece and those who desire a good customer service that backs up their product.", "helpful": 1}, {"polarity": "crit", "name": "federico fellini", "stars": 3.0, "title": "Wheels constantly clog on hardwood floors", "content": "This is an excellent vacuum however it has one MAJOR design flaw, the small wheels constantly clog up on hardwood floors and about every three days I have to take them apart and clean them with a small flathead screwdriver.
